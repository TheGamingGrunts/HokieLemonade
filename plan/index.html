		 		<h2 class="ctitle">Our Plan of Attack</h2>
		 		<p><i><csmall>Updated: September 3, 2014.</csmall></i></p>
		 		<h3>Intro</h3>
		 		<p>
		 			As a team, we have come up with what we believe to be a successful business plan in attempt to not only be the group who sells the most lemonade, but also the group to raise the most money for charity, which, in our case, is Next Generation Nepal. This charity was co-founded by the author of Little Princes, Conor Grennan. We chose this specific charity due to the personal impact the novel had on the entire team. After reading about the deplorable conditions the children in Nepal have to endure in their day-to-day lives, we decided that we had to take action and do as much as we possibly could in order to give those children a chance to achieve a better lifestyle. We believe that our best chance of doing this is by donating the proceeds of our project to Next Generation Nepal (More info: http://www.nextgenerationnepal.org/). 
				</p>
		 		<h3>Team Responsibilities</h3>
		 		<p>
		 			As our team representative, Laura Graves will make sure everything runs as smoothly as possible and is in charge of compiling all of our documents and submitting them. Every other member of the team has their own responsibilities and will each play a key role in the success of the team, including gathering the necessary resources for the stand and spreading the word about our project.
		 		</p>
		 		<h3>Goals</h3>
		 		<p>
		 			We have a few sales goals regarding our business.  We want to work effectively and cooperatively as teammates.  We can do so by communicating clearly with each other and planning out our next steps together. This will be done through various means, including texting, email, and various Google products, such as Docs, Slides, and Spreadsheets.  In addition to this, we also plan to hold short meetings to plan and discuss current and future situations.  
		 		</p>
		 		<h3>Promotion</h3>
		 		<p>
		 			In order to promote our business, we will create a website, which will outline various aspects of the project, as well as our goals. In addition to that, we will create various social media pages (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) in order to interact with our potential customers and give them a reason to buy our product. 
		 		</p>
		 		<h3>Stand Operation</h3>
		 		<p>
		 			When it comes to operating the lemonade stand, we plan on buying three different cup sizes and selling them for different prices in order to provide our customers with more variety. Our prices will range from one dollar for small, one dollar and fifty cents for medium and two dollars for large. In order to increase sales and add a bit of variety, we will also be selling cookies. We plan to reach these goals by collaborating and strategically coming up with the best time(s) and location(s) for our lemonade stand. 
		 		</p>
		 		<h3>Priorities</h3>
		 		<p>
		 			Our three main immediate priorities are to set a date for our lemonade stand, establish a location, and gather all the resources needed to operate the stand.  We have made a list of all the products we need. Each person is assigned to be in charge of bringing what they signed up for. This way, we can easily get all the items collected and work as a group to set up our stand.
		 		</p>
		 		<h3>Locations and Time</h3>
		 		<p>
		 			Since we have a relatively large amount of people on our team, we thought it would be smart to take shifts running the stands. The places we decided  to set up our lemonade stand at are churches since there are going to be many people on Sunday during the early or regular sessions. Before we do this, however, we are going to ask these churches for permission to set up our table(s) on Sunday September 7th and 14th. In addition to that, we also are considering setting up table(s) on Main Street on Saturdays, however we have not decided exactly which dates yet.
		 		</p>
		 		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		 		<p>
		 			If each one of our sales goals is met and hopefully each one will be, our team is highly capable of selling the most lemonade. However, this will only be accomplished if we function and work well together as a team. The business plan and duties we created as a team should allow us to reach our final goal which is to obtain a substantial profit for our class as well as for the charity we are donating to.
